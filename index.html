            <p>In March of 2022 I accepted my first Prop-Master/Art Director position.
                Since then I have 5 Art Director credits and 2 Production Designer credits.
                it's a position that demands high levels of problem solving, adapdability, 
                grace under pressure, and steady leadership on set. And as I tell my crews, "I <em>love</em> being in the shit".
